  <br>Based in Southend, Essex, UK. Tug (guitar/Vox) Steve (lead guitar) Luke (bass) and Steve (drums) thrive as a D.I.Y band. Early 90's guitar driven rock with the catchiest of melodies is in their DNA. Initially The Fishes And I was the performing name of guitarist and vocalist Tug. Around 2014 Tug had moved away from his hometown of Southend on Sea, Essex to Enfield, North London and was writing a lot of new songs. Playing across London's open mic circuit he soon realised the songs needed a band behind them. By mid 2016 he had moved again to Letchworth, Hertfordshire and got to work building a studio to record the songs. In 2017 he teamed up with former bandmates Sean (drums) and Luke (bass) to form as a 3 piece. In September that year saw their first live show with the release of ''Turning Tides'' and by late 2018 they had become a formidable live act. Early 2019 saw the arrival of Steve (lead guitar) which further propelled their live shows. By late 2019 they went into recording their new songs which are set to be released in Autumn of 2021.<br>
