  <br>The Fishes And I herald from Southend-on-Sea, in the UK. Tug (guitar/vocalsx), Steve (lead guitar), Luke (bass) and Steve (drums) thrive as a D.I.Y band. Early 90's guitar driven rock with the catchiest of melodies is in their DNA.</br>
  <br>Initially, The Fishes And I was just the performing name of guitarist and vocalist Tug. In 2014, Tug moved from his hometown of Southend-on-Sea, to Enfield in North London. He was writing a lot of new songs and playing across London's open mic circuit but he soon realised the songs needed a band behind them.</br>
  <br>By mid 2016 he moved again to Hertfordshire, got to work building a studio to record the songs, and in 2017 he teamed up with former bandmates to form a 3-piece. September that year saw their first live show with the release of ''Turning Tides'' and by late 2018 they had become a formidable live act.</br>
  <br>Early 2019 saw the arrival of Steve (lead guitar) which further propelled their live shows and they started to record new songs which are set to be released at some point in the near future.</br>
