  <br>Roaring guitars and heart on the sleeve vocals are the blueprint for this band who herald from Southend-on-Sea, in the UK. Tug (guitar/vocals), Luke Mackenzie (bass), Steve Roberts (lead guitar), and Steve Gee (drums) thrive as a D.I.Y band. Guitar-driven rock married with the catchiest of melodies is in their DNA.</br>
  <br>Initially, The Fishes And I was the performing name of guitarist and vocalist Tug. In 2014, Tug moved from his hometown of Southend-on-Sea, to North London. Tug was writing a lot of new songs and playing across London's open mic circuit when he realised the songs needed a full band behind them.</br>
  <br>During 2016 Tug moved again to Hertfordshire, where he set about building his own studio to record the songs. In 2017 Tug teamed up with former bandmates to form a three-piece and September that year saw their first live show along with the release of Tug's debut EP. 'Turning Tides' quickly went on to be streamed over 10,000 times and by late 2018, The Fishes And I had become a formidable live act.</br>
  <br>2019 saw the arrival of Steve Roberts (lead guitar) and 2023 saw the arrival of Steve Gee (drums). These guys further propel the live shows and new songs are set to be released in the near future.</br>
